Conditions as Events
--------------------

The entries in a condition table represent the events that are
interesting, the ones that affect the flow of the game and the way in
which the data is transformed. This means that the condition tables
drive the flow, but they themselves are tables that can be manipulated,
so they can self modify, which means we can use this technique to
provide high perfomance data-driven, yet data-oriented development
practices.

Condition tables are tables that can have rows inserted or deleted just
like any other table. If the rows are added, modified, or removed based
on the same rules as everything else, then you have a data-driven
general purpose development model. One that doesnâ€™t even sacrifice
performance for flexibility.
