Data centric development in hardware design
-------------------------------------------

Once software solutions concentrate on transforming data, what changes
can we expect from hardware vendors? Is that a silly question? Would a
change of programming paradigm really affect the people who create
hardware?

What should we promote and demote in order to get the most from our
transistors?

move away from serial thinking more functional programming, where there
are no side-effects, leads to solutions for infinite numbers of cores

Whatever the future brings with respect to hardware and processing
configurations, there are certain assumptions we can make.
