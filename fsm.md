Finite State Machines
=====================

Finite state machines are a solid solution to many game logic problems.
They are the building block of most medium level AI code, and provide
testable frameworks for user interfaces. Notoriously convoluted finite
state machines rule the world of memory card operations and network
lobbies, while simple ones hold domain over point and click adventure
puzzle logic. Finite state machines are highly data driven in that they
react to an alphabet of signals, and change state based on both the
signal received, and their current state.
