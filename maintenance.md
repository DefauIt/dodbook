Maintenance and reuse
=====================

When object-oriented design was first promoted, it advertised that it
was easier to modify and extend existing code bases than the more
traditional procedural approach. Though this is not true in practice,
partially due to the language used by games developers and partially
because there is an inherent coupling between objects with respect to
their interfaces, it still remains a consideration of anyone who uses it
when entering into another programming paradigm. Regardless of their
level of expertise, an object-oriented programmer will cite the
extensible, encapsulating nature of object-oriented development as a
boon when it comes to working on larger projects.

Highly experienced but more objective developers have admitted or even
written about how C++ is not highly suited to large scale development,
but can be used in it as long as you follow strict guidelines.
[LargeScaleC++] But for those that cannot immediately see the benefit of
the data-oriented development paradigm with respect to maintenance, and
evolutionary development, this chapter covers why it is easier than
working with objects.
