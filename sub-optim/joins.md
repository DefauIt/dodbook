Joins as intersections
----------------------

Sometimes, normalisation can mean you need to join tables together to
create the right situation for a query. Unlike RDBMS queries, we can
organise our queries much more carefully and use the algorithm from
merge sort to help us zip together two tables. As an alternative, we
donâ€™t have to output to a table, it could be a pass through transform
that takes more than one table and generates a new stream into another
transform. For example, per entityRenderable, join with entityPosition
by entityID, to transform with AddRenderCall( Renderable, Position )
