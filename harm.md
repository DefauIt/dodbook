What’s wrong?
=============

What’s wrong with Object-Oriented Design? Where’s the harm in it?

Over the years, games developers have taught themselves to write a style
of C++ that is so unappealing to any current or future hardware, that
the managed languages don’t seem all that much slower in comparison. The
current pattern of usage of C++ in games development is so appallingly
mismatched to current console hardware that it is no wonder that an
interpreted language is only in the region of 50% slower under normal
use and sometimes faster[^1] in their specialist areas. What is this
strange language that has embedded itself into the minds of C++ games
developers? What is it that makes the fashionable way of coding games
one of the worst ways of making use of the machines we’re targeting?
Where, in essence, is the harm in game-development style object-oriented
C++?


[^1]: http://keithlea.com/javabench/ tells the tale of the server JVM
    being faster than C++. There’s some arguments against the results,
    but there’s others that back it up. Read, make up your own mind.
